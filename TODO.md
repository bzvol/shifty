- Sort and group shifts:
  - [ ] Sort by date, displaying in a sticky header
  - [ ] Group by zone
    (can be done inversely too)
  - [ ] Matching shifts should be grouped together:
    - When assigning, swap shifts have priority to unassigned shifts.
    - If there are multiple swaps or unassigneds, the app chooses one randomly.
